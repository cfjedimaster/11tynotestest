This site is my second brain. It's a place to collect my thoughts, ideas, and notes on code-related topics. I use it to keep track of things I've learned, and to share what I've learned with others.

The first version of this site was built and released as a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) theme ([Code Notes](https://github.com/mrmartineau/gatsby-theme-code-notes)) but I've since rebuilt it using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev). This is a list of tools and resources I use to build this site.

- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator
- [Shiki Twoslash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/) syntax highlighting
- [Algolia search](https://algolia.com) using [this tutorial](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/06/24/adding-algolia-search-to-eleventy-and-netlify) as a base
- [Utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
