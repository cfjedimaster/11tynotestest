## Substitute or Find/Replace

To find each occurrence of ‘pick’ in the current line only, and replace it with ‘s’, enter (first press Esc key and type):

```
:%s/pick/s/g
```

To find and replace all occurrences of ‘pick’ with ‘s’, enter:

```
:%s/pick/s/g
```

To find and replace all occurrences of ‘pick’ with ‘s’, but ask for confirmation first, enter:

```
:%s/pick/s/gc
```

To find and replace all occurrences of case insensitive ‘eth1’ with ‘br1’, enter:

```
:%s/eth1/br1/gi
```

The above example will find eth1, ETH1, eTh1, ETh1 and so on and replace with br1. To find and replace all occurrences of ‘eth1’ with ‘br1’ for lines from 3 to 7, enter:

```
:3,7s/eth1/br1/g
```
